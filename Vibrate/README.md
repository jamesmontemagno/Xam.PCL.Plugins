## Vibrate

Simple but elegant way of performing Vibrate in your Xamarin, Windows, and Xamarin.Forms projects

* Xamarin.iOS
* Xamarin.iOS (x64 Unified)

**ANDROID Specific**
Please ensure you have the VIBRATE persmission enabled:

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.VIBRATE" />
```

#### API Usage

To gain access to the Vibrate class simply use this method:

```
var v = CrossVibrate.Current;
```

#### Methods

```
 CrossVibrate.Current.Vibrate(int milliseconds = 500);
